# Accident-Data-Visualization-Analysis
In this project, I collected accident data of 12 consequtive months, and divided the dataset into three catagories for the Division "Chittagong". I wanted to make you visulize the dataset for better understanding of what's usually going on with Bangladeshi regualar vehicles. I tried to show overall trends of accident over time, number of accidents per vehicle per month. I showed correlations among the vehicles to see if there is any significant conncetion between any two vehicle. I performed Chi-Square test to describe whether the distribution of vehicle types involved in accidents is independent from the severity or fatalities. Moreover, I found risk ratios to understand which vehicles are more likely to involved in crash and also predict the future accident curve for some major risky vehicles.
